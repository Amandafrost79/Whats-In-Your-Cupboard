## Overview

"What's In Your Cupboard?!" aims to alleviate the everyday stress of meal planning. It's perfect for those evenings when you're unsure what to cook with the limited ingredients at hand. No more last-minute grocery store runs or staring into your fridge wondering what to make!

## Features

- **Ingredient-based Recipe Suggestions**: Enter the ingredients you have, and we'll suggest a recipe you can make right away.
- **Random Recipe Generator**: Spice up your meals with new and exciting recipe ideas.

## Built With

- **HTML**: Structured the content of our website.
- **CSS**: Styled and brought life to the website's design.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity, managing the recipe suggestions, and the favorites feature.

## Inspiration

This project was born out of my personal need as a full-time working mom and student. The goal was to create a tool that makes life easier for anyone who finds 24 hours insufficient to juggle daily responsibilities.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Input the ingredients you have in your cupboard.
2. **Recipe Suggestion**: Our algorithm suggests recipes based on your ingredients.
3. **Random Recipes**: Get inspired by our random recipe generator for new meal ideas.
4. **Save Favorites**: Like a recipe? Save it to your favorites for future reference.
