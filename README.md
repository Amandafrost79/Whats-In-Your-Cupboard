# What's In Your Cupboard?!

Welcome to "What's in Your Cuboard?!". As my first project as a student at Get Coding NL, I decided to build a recipe website that would give the user recipes based on ingredients they already had at home. No runnning to the grocery store at the last minute and no staring blankly into a fridge wondering what am I gonna make tonight??

My project is geared towards mom's like me who work all day and learn all night! Just really anyone like myself who finds 24 hours are just not cutting it to get everything done that needs to be done in the course of a day.

If you feel overwhelmed and over worked and you come home to bare cupboards cause you dont have time to keep up with the shopping list throughout the week. Then sit back and let "what's in your cupboard?!" do the heavy lifting of meal ideas with the simple ingredients you have right at your fingertips!!

Tell us what you have, and we'll tell you what delicious meal you can make tonight!! Your whole family will be remembering why they call you "SUPER MOM"!!
