# First-Project
My first coding project

My project is geared towards mom's like me who work all day and learn all night!  Just really anyone like myself who finds 24 hours are just not cutting it to get everything done that needs to be done in the course of a day. 

If you feel overwhelmed and over worked and you come home to bare cupboards cause you dont have time to keep up with the shopping list throughoout your week. Then sit back and let "what's in your cupboard?!" do the heavy lifting of meal ideas with the simple imgredients you have right at your fingertips!!

Tell us what you have, and we'll tell you what deliciuos meal you can make tonight!! Your whole family will be remembering why they call you "SUPERMOM"!!
